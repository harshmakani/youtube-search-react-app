Simple React application bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and consuming Youtube API to search and display videos.

I have set the default search to "One Republic - Kids". My favourite song!

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
